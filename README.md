## Project Overview

This project contains a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project exhibits an ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.
